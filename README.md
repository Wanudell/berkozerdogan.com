Creating a site with Vue.js

I'm using Vue.js, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and more for it.

In this project, I will develop my site with my research. I will be using new technologies and applying them on my site to create a portfolio for myself.

I will add the backend side in the coming days. First of all, I will use the API, I am aiming to send ajax requests from the Frontend and show the data from my database for now.
